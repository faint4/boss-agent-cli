# Capability Matrix

Use this matrix to keep CLI, skills, and MCP integrations aligned across different agent entry points.

Compatibility modes `assisted` and `research` can both call every implemented capability and no longer produce mode-level `COMPLIANCE_BLOCKED`. Missing platform implementations return `NOT_SUPPORTED`; long workflows remain bounded, redacted, checkpointed, and stoppable. Use `boss schema` availability and risk metadata as the source of truth.

Notes:
- **Transport**: `httpx` means a direct API call. Risk-control blocks stop the workflow. Browser/hook adapters may not retry without bounds and must preserve checkpoints and redaction. `AI service` means a third-party model API; do not send chat records, resumes, or contact details without authorization.
- For CLI-first integrations, prefer `boss schema` for capability discovery and parameter validation; the schema exposes both `supported_platforms` and `supported_recruiter_platforms`.
- Current platform coverage: `zhipin` has both candidate and recruiter implementations; `zhilian` supports candidate-side workflows and recruiter automation through the `agent` browser/CDP adapter V1; `qiancheng` / 51job is a registered placeholder adapter whose real workflows return `NOT_SUPPORTED`.
- `crawl` uses an isolated Chrome profile, cross-process rate budgets, SQLite checkpoints, and the `crawl stop` kill switch. Fine-grained MCP crawl tools provide local `crawl_status/results/shortlist` operations for existing runs, while `boss_wizard` can start, resume, and stop the shared workflow. The default Hook is `none`; local Hook directories must provide `SHA256SUMS`. Risk codes, a security page, or an exhausted budget stop it and return a resume command.
- Use `boss schema` as the source of truth: it currently exposes 40 top-level commands, with 9 first-level recruiter subcommands under `hr`, while `ai` and `resume` remain command-group entries.
